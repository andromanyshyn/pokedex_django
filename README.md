# Pokedex
Using the open pokemon API (http://pokeapi.co) build a pokedex with the following functionality:
## Back End Requirements:
List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show)

The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50)

Filter the pokemons by name with a search box

Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected)

A profile page where the user can see a list of his favorite pokemons (each pokemon needs to have a star icon to make it favorite)
